# Flashy - French to English Flashcard App

**Flashy** is a capstone project that helps users learn French vocabulary. The program displays a French word, and the user has 3 seconds to guess its English translation. After that, the card flips to reveal the correct English word. Users can mark whether they knew the translation or not, and words that were guessed correctly are removed from the learning pool.

## Features

- Display French words for the user to translate.
- Flip the card automatically after 3 seconds to show the English translation.
- Track progress by removing known words from the learning set.
- Use a visual interface with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## How It Works

1. The program starts by showing a French word.
2. If the user knows the English translation, they can click the **right** button. If not, they click the **wrong** button.
3. After 3 seconds, the card flips to reveal the correct answer.
4. Words marked as known are removed from the learning set, and the progress is saved for future sessions.

## Installation

## Future Improvements

Add sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.
Provide a way to add custom word sets.
Add a progress tracking feature to visualize learning over time.
